CTC: 6.2 lpa (Intern + FTE)


There were a total of 4 rounds (2 aptitude and 2 interview rounds). Initially, they mentioned there would be 3 interview rounds (2 Technical and 1 HR), but due to time constraints, there was only 1 Technical round and 1 HR round.

Round 1: Online Aptitude Round

This was a reasoning-based round consisting of 30 questions in 60 minutes. The questions were based on logical reasoning and mathematics, including topics like angles, speed, probability, etc.

Out of approximately 100 students, 23 were shortlisted for the next round.

Round 2: Offline Aptitude Test (Pen-and-Paper Round)

This round consisted of 4 questions that had to be solved on paper. I remember a few of the questions:
1. Which is greater: √3 + √2 or √6? Prove this.
2. Draw the graph of the equation y = x² + 2.
3. For question 2, find the area under the curve from [-2, 2].
4. I don’t remember the fourth question exactly.
Round 3: Technical Interview

This was a 20-minute round. The interviewer went through my resume and noticed I was studying DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms), so he asked a few related questions:

1. What data structure would you use to show the relationship between employees?
I said I would use a graph. He asked me why I chose a graph and how I would represent it in code. I explained that I would use an adjacency matrix or list. He then asked me to create an adjacency matrix, so I said I would use a 2D vector. As soon as I started writing vector<vector<int>, he stopped me and asked what the angular brackets (< >) were used for. I explained that they were used for generics, and we had a brief 2-3 minute discussion on generics.

2. He also asked me a few questions on pointers, including the types of pointers.

3. Since I mentioned AR/VR and 3D simulation in my resume, we also discussed those topics.

At the end of the interview, he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked what my role would be if everything went well.

End of Round 3.

Round 4: HR Interview

This was a standard HR round. She asked me to tell her something about myself so she could get to know who "Saurav" is. She also asked what I do in my free time, my daily schedule, and about my family. She noticed I had solved LeetCode problems, so she asked how many questions I could solve in a day.

The last two questions were:
1. Why CCtech?
2. What do you know about CCtech?
End of Round 4.

Verdict: Selected for the Member of Technical Staff role.
