Q1.
Being a Software Engineer (Testing) requires you to be a software detective. You have to use your intuition, judgement, and clues to figure out where the bugs might be hiding. The problem below requires you to be such a detective.

(Note: there are 3 very similar questions in this test. The question looks the same, but each time, it has a different bug.)

Consider this mini-online program. If you enter a list of comma-separated integers, and click Process, it should print the same list in sorted order under Output. It is a little limited in the input formats it can understand, so it will give you an "Invalid Input" message if it is not able to parse the input you entered.

Input a list of comma separated numbers: _____________

Process 
Output:


However, there is a bug in this mini-program. There are certain inputs for which, it gives a wrong answer (i.e. the numbers are not really sorted properly.) Can you find an input string for which this mini- program gives an incorrect answer? Once you've found such an input string, please enter it in the Answer box below, and click submit. (Note: do not submit an input that results in Invalid Input. You must submit something that results in a wrong answer.)

Q2.
Half of a doctor's life was over before he got his degree. After that he spent 1/3rd of his life working for a big hospital. Then he started his private practice and spent 1/10th of his life doing this. However, he had to retire at this point because of health issues, and died 4 years later? How old was he when he retired?

Answer:

Q4.
Hashtables #2

Given an array containing strings, you have to find duplicate strings in this array. You solve the problem by building a hashtable with those strings and use that hashtable to find duplicates. Which of the following statements are true? (Unless otherwise stated, assume that the hash-function and hash-table are working well and doing a good job.)

Pick all that apply

a. In most cases, the program will run in O(n) time
b. In most cases, the program will run in O(n log n) time
c. In most cases, the program will run in O(n^2) time
d. If the hash-function is a doing a bad job, and there are lots of collisions, the program will run in O(n log n) time
e. If the hash-function is a doing a bad job, and there are lots of collisions, the program will run in O(n^2) time

Q5. 
See this implementation of a hash function. It will be used for putting C-style null-terminated char * strings in a hashtable:

int hash(char *str) {
}
return strlen(str); /* return Length of string */

Which of the following statements are true?

Pick all that apply

a. This is an invalid hash function, because hash function should return a bitmap
b. This is a good hash function because it returns different values for different strings
c. This is a bad hash function because it returns the same value for all strings of the same length. 
d. This will cause the hashtable implementation to crash because it can return the same hash value for different strings
e. This will cause the hashtable implementation to be inefficient because it will cause the same hash value to be returned for many different strings

Q6.
You need to use a map data structure as follows:
• It stores (key, value) pairs, and both the key and value are of type String
• Inserting a new (key, value) pair in the map must have a performance time of O(log n) in the worst cases
• Looking up a key in the map must have a performance time of O(log n) in the worst case
• It is expected to be a main-memory data structure

Q7.
Array filtering

This code filters an array to remove all numbers less than 0 from it:

void filter(ArrayList<Integer> b) {
int i=0;
while(i<b.size())
if (b.get(i) < 0)
else
b.remove(i);
i++;
}

Which of the following statements is true? (Note: in Java, an ArrayList is not implemented as a linked list. It is a regular array, but provides methods of the List interface. Based on this information, you should be able to answer this question even if you don't know Java.)

Pick all that apply

a. The running time complexity of this program is O(n)
b. The running time complexity of this program is O(n log n)
c. The running time complexity of this program is O(n^2)
d. Such a program can never work because it is modifying the same array that it is looping over 
e. Such a program can never work because such a remove method cannot be implemented for an array

Why COBOL?

Consider this passage:

The COBOL core banking system has capabilities that are not replicated by the off the shelf systems pushed by the vendors today (despite their claims). Nobody really knows how the old code actually works. Reverse engineering it would be a huge project. Huge projects fail as a rule. That is why the bank is still using COBOL

Pick all that apply

a. Today's vendors claim that their new systems have the same capabilities as the older COBOL systems
b. New systems have the same capabilities as the older COBOL systems

Q17.
Consider this statement:

Jai: IITs are producing great engineers, who ultimately end up benefiting science and technology in India, but more important is the fact that they are greatly improving the image of India in the west
Vijay: No, you're mistaken. Producing great engineers who benefit science and technology in India is the most important function of IITs. Without IITs, most of our software industry wouldn't have existed.

Which of these points do Jai and Vijay disagree about?

Select the closest option

a. Whether IITs produce great engineers
b. Whether IITs improve the image of India abroad
c. Whether IITs are important to India or not, because most of their great engineers end up migrating to the west
d. Whether producing great engineers who benefit science and technology in India is the most important function of IITs
e. Whether improving the image of India abroad is important

Q18.
Consider this statement:

In 2002, the IIT JEE entrance exam was a subjective exam. Various student and parent groups raised objections to this, but their objections were ignored by the JEE management. Data from the results of the 2002 test showed that non-English medium school students had fared very badly in the JEE. Soon after the results were announced, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed against the method of conducting the JEE in the courts. During this PIL, the court ruled that the subjective nature of the JEE is unfair to certain section of students. As a result, from then on, the JEE has always been conducted as a purely objective test.

Which of the following statements follow logicaly from this:

Select the closest option

a. Before 2002, students from non-English medium schools always fared badly in JEE
b. The JEE is now an objective test because of the court ruling in the PIL.
c. If the JEE management had paid attention to the objections raised by student/parent groups, the PIL could have been avoided
d. Before 2002, JEE was a subjective test because the JEE management believed that a subjective test is better than an objective test
e. Use of a purely objective test for JEE 2002 would have prevented the PIL
